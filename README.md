Ali Hamidi's Webscript.io Lib
=============

Some useful libs for importing into Webscript.io

_Please note this is a work in progress!_

stathat.lua - Webscript port of the Stathat Lua library
redis.lua - Lua Redis library (Doesn't work since Webscript doesn't provide access to lua socket)
couchdb.lua - Webscript library for accessing CouchDB (only really tested with Cloudant)
analytics.lua - Webscript library for tracking events within persistent storage (for use with couchdb)
